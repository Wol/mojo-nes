## About CAD files
CAD design files are for KiCAD Open Source electronics design suite. Please install latest version along with KiCAD libraries to open it. When opening schematic, KiCAD will most likely complain about missing library "doragasu". Despite this warning, the schematic should load nicely (using the cached libraries). To avoid this message, install [the missing library](https://github.com/doragasu/doragasu-kicad-lib) and make sure to configure it in the schematic editor.
